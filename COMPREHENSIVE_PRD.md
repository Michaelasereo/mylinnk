# **ODIM PLATFORM PRD: RELIABILITY & SCALING ROADMAP**
*From MVP to Production-Ready Platform*

---

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

**Current State:** Functional MVP with core business logic but critical gaps in reliability, security, and user experience.

**Critical Issues Identified:**
- 🔴 Payment atomicity failures (chargebacks risk)
- 🔴 Race condition vulnerabilities (booking conflicts)
- 🔴 Session management gaps (progress loss)
- 🔴 Missing input validation (security risks)
- 🔴 No retry mechanisms (service outages break platform)

**Phase 2 Goal:** Transform from "works when everything goes right" to "works even when things go wrong."

**Business Impact:** Prevent revenue loss, reduce support costs, enable scaling from MVP to enterprise platform.

## **CURRENT SYSTEM ASSESSMENT**

---

## **CRITICAL SYSTEM GAPS**

### **🔴 PAYMENT RELIABILITY (HIGHEST BUSINESS RISK)**
**Current Issue:** Payments can succeed while database updates fail, causing chargebacks and lost revenue.

**Impact:** Direct financial loss, customer disputes, platform liability.

**Required Fixes:**
1. **Webhook Retry Queue** - Handle Paystack webhook failures with exponential backoff
2. **Payment Reconciliation** - Hourly job to sync failed payments
3. **Atomic Transactions** - Database transactions for payment + business logic
4. **Duplicate Prevention** - Idempotency checks for webhook processing

### **🔴 DATA CONSISTENCY (SYSTEM INTEGRITY)**
**Current Issue:** Race conditions cause double bookings, balance corruption, orphaned records.

**Impact:** Overbooking, incorrect payouts, data integrity violations.

**Required Fixes:**
1. **Database Locking** - Row-level locks for availability and balance updates
2. **Optimistic Concurrency** - Version checks for concurrent modifications
3. **Transaction Scoping** - Proper transaction boundaries for multi-step operations
4. **Constraint Validation** - Database-level constraints to prevent invalid states

### **🟡 SESSION & STATE MANAGEMENT (USER EXPERIENCE)**
**Current Issue:** Users lose progress during onboarding, payments fail mid-flow.

**Impact:** User abandonment, incomplete profiles, failed transactions.

**Required Fixes:**
1. **Progress Persistence** - localStorage/sessionStorage for multi-step flows
2. **Session Validation** - Middleware for authenticated route protection
3. **State Recovery** - Resume capability for interrupted workflows
4. **Timeout Handling** - Proper session expiration with clear messaging

### **🟡 SECURITY & VALIDATION (PLATFORM PROTECTION)**
**Current Issue:** Missing input validation, no rate limiting, vulnerable to abuse.

**Impact:** Security breaches, service disruption, compliance violations.

**Required Fixes:**
1. **Input Sanitization** - XSS prevention, SQL injection protection
2. **Rate Limiting** - API abuse prevention on all endpoints
3. **Authentication Checks** - Session validation on all protected routes
4. **Audit Logging** - Track sensitive operations for security monitoring

### **🟢 EXTERNAL SERVICE RESILIENCE (RELIABILITY)**
**Current Issue:** Service outages cause complete platform failures.

**Impact:** Service unavailability, user frustration, revenue loss.

**Required Fixes:**
1. **Retry Logic** - Exponential backoff for external API failures
2. **Circuit Breakers** - Graceful degradation during outages
3. **Fallback Mechanisms** - Alternative flows when primary services fail
4. **Offline Support** - Queue operations for later processing
